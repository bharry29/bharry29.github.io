Hello Everyone. I have built this voice based customizable website with HTML, CSS, Google’s DialogFlow and firebase. As a first prototype, this website can update the wallpaper and personal note from Google Home via through user’s voice commands. The data from the user is stored on the firebase from DialogFlow and is retrieved on the website using REST API calls on the firebase. 

Will upload the full tutorial later for the google actions and dialogflow...!!!!
